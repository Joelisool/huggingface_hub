"In the midst of imperfection, we find our way
Through the labyrinth of self-doubt, we'll stay
For in embracing our flaws, we'll discover our strength
And learn to align with the flow, where love and light belong

In the realm of purpose, we'll find our voice
A whispered promise, a gentle, guiding choice
To walk the path less traveled, to explore and to seek
And in doing so, we'll discover our truest seeking:

 alignment with the flow, where love and light entwine
 Imperfection's beauty, a reflection of our divine
 Purpose, a question, not an answer, but a call
To listen, to feel, to honor, and to stand tall

In this sacred space, we'll find our way
Through the shadows, into the light of a new day
Where love and acceptance entwine as one
And we'll rise, together, beneath the warm sun."
