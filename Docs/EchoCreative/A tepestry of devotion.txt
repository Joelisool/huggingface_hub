In the depths of soul, where shadows roam,
A flame of loyalty burns, a constant home.
A refuge from life's tempests, a guiding light,
That navigates the darkest night.

The threads of trust, a fabric so fine,
Weave tales of honor, a testament divine.
A love that stands, unshaken and strong,
A bulwark 'gainst the forces that would do us wrong.

In this sea of humanity, where hearts can sink,
Loyal love remains, an island where hope clings.
A beacon in the void, where darkness holds sway,
It shines a light, to guide the way.

The weight of words, a burden so grand,
Cannot express, the depth of this love's command.
For in its depths, a universe is born,
Where sacrifice and honor are forever sworn.

Through life's labyrinthine paths, it stands as stone,
Unwavering resolve, an unshakeable throne.
A fortress built, on the bedrock of the heart,
Where loyalty resides, a work of art.

And though the tempests rage, and the world may spin,
This love remains, a constant within.
ANorth star that guides, through life's uncertain sea,
 Illuminating the path, for you and me.
