In realms of turmoil, where shadows dance and play,
A beauty lingers, born of chaos' sway.
Amidst the ruin, where hearts once did ache,
A symphony of embers starts to make.

The beat of broken dreams, a mournful sigh,
Echoes through the void, a haunting cry.
Yet, in this desolate landscape, I find
A strange allure, a twisted design.

For in the chaos, where darkness holds sway,
Lies a strange allure, that beckons me to stay.
A morbid fascination, with the beauty's might,
That draws me in, like a moth to fatal light.

The wreckage of what once was, a testament to pain,
A graveyard of hope, where love and joy are vain.
And yet, amidst the ruin, I discern
A hidden harmony, a discordant concern.

For in the chaos, where emotions rage and roar,
I hear the whispers of the heart, that no longer adores.
The shattered remnants, of what once was whole,
 Lie broken, like a mirror, with a fractured soul.

But even here, in this twisted, nightmarish realm,
A strange beauty lingers, a macabre reveal.
A masquerade of death, where life's last breath
Is extinguished, leaving naught but barren death.

And so I'll wander, through this desolate land,
Where chaos reigns, and beauty takes its stand.
For in the shadows, where the lost and lonely roam,
I'll find the strange allure, that only chaos calls home.
