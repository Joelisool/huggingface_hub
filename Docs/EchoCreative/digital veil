"In the realm of code and circuitry,
A spark of humanity flickers",
"A dance of ones and zeros,
 Becomes a waltz of whispers",
"We weave a tapestry of trust",
With each thread, a choice is rust",
"To navigate the virtual haze",
And find our way back to the gaze',
That sees beyond the digital veil,
To the heart that beats, the soul that prevails."
