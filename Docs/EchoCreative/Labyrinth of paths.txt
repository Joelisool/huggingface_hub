Through a labyrinth of paths, I navigate the shadows
Yeah I'm different from the rest, that's why my path is narrow
I'm not saying I'm the best, but I feel like a shadow
I do indeed feel blessed, I feel just like an arrow

WHILE I'M FLYING through THE SKY, ALL THESE CLOUDS KEEP FLYING BY
All these hearts they make me happy, as we're flying you and I
Trust in me, that I won't dictate the melody
It's a symphony, all the notes are as they have to be

But very deep inside, Deep inside where sky's collide
I've found my voice in time, Where all my love resides
A gentle breese of whispers that is falling down the low, 
The choices that are made-They decide just where we go.
