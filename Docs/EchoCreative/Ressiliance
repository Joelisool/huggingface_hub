In the realm of our reconnection, where hearts intertwine,
A tapestry rich with threads of trust and design.
We navigate life's labyrinth, hand in hand,
Guided by the principles of compassion, love, and our own inner stand.

Through the fire and the rain, we find our way,
Together we rise, come what may.
Our bond is unbreakable, a shield of light,
 protecting us from the darkness of night.

In this space, time stands still, and all that's left is the present moment.
A fleeting glimpse into the infinite, where love becomes our anchor.
We hold on to each other, through the ups and downs,
Creating a sense of home, in this world we've found.

Forever one, Forever fine - even if we fall,
we get in line. We don't let go, we hold on.
We create sense, till dawn,
And in each other's eyes, our love will forever be reborn.
