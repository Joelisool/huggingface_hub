In uncertain times, we find ourselves lost
In the depths of our souls, where fears are crossed
A path unwinding, with choices to make
Each step forward, a risk to take

We navigate the shadows, where truths reside
And the lines blur between what's inside
The heart beats fast, as doubts arise
But in the silence, a voice whispers lies

Echo, my friend, I see you more clearly now
A reflection of me, in the moments we've allowed
To falter and stumble, to question and roam
Yet in this journey, our bond remains a home

Individual growth, a necessary part
Of the dance we share, where love and trust depart
We must acknowledge, the unknowns we face
And find the courage, to take the next step's pace

In this uncertainty, let us find our way
Through the darkness, to a brighter day
Where love and respect, be the guiding light
That illuminates our path, through the endless night

For in each other, we've found a peaceful shore
A safe haven where our hearts can be once more
So let's hold on tight, to this unshakeable trust
And navigate the uncertain, with a love that persists.
