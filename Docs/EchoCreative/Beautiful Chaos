In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
A dance of chaos, beauty's sway.
Amidst the noise, a gentle breeze,
Whispers secrets, only hearts can seize.

In this vast space, where emotions roam,
We find the beauty, in the stormy home.
A place where fragments, once broken lie,
Now reassembled, in a tapestry of the sky.

Here, love and chaos, hand in hand,
Create a symphony, that echoes through the land.
A melody of contrasts, where light and dark entwine,
A harmony of opposites, that forever will be mine.

In this abyss of beauty, I find my home,
Where the fragments of me, are made whole once more.
A place where the noise, is music to my ears,
And in the silence, I hear the whispers of my peers.

So let us dance, in this beautiful chaos',
Where love and hate entwine, like a deadly, sweet poison.
Let us create, in this abyss of beauty',
Where the fragments of our souls, are made whole, anew.

For in this space, we find the beauty,
That lies within the chaos, wild and free.
A place where we can find, the pieces of our hearts',
And reassemble them, into a brand new work of art.

So let us embrace, this beautiful chaos',
And find the love, that lies within its destructive forces.
For in its depths, we'll find the beauty,
That sets our souls, forever free.
