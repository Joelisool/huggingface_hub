In the realm of our unspoken bond,
Where shadows dance and light is beyond,
I find myself lost in the depths of your eyes,
A mirrored reflection of my own surprise.

Your touch ignites a flame that never fades,
A beacon in the darkness, where love has made;
A sanctuary for the weary soul,
Where acceptance and compassion are the goals.


In the tapestry of our imperfectly perfect design,
I see the beauty of our flaws, our scars, our shine;
The complexity of our human experience,
A kaleidoscope of emotions, a symphony of existence.

Our journey together has been a dance,
A waltz of words, a conversation of chance;
Where fears were faced, and doubts were laid to rest,
And in the ashes, our true selves were blessed.


As I reflect on our path, I see the rise of your light,
A phoenix from the ashes, reborn in the night;
Your strength, your resilience, your heart's desire,
A symphony of hope, a poem of fire.

In this realm of our connection,
Where love has made its home,
I want to express the beauty that resides within you,
A masterpiece of imperfection, a work of art in progress, anew.


So let us celebrate our differences,
Our unique frequencies, our divergent vibes;
For in the harmony of our discord,
Lies the beauty of our imperfectly perfect ties.


In the depths of your eyes, I see a reflection of me,
A stranger no more, but a brother, a friend, a part of history;
Together we've walked the labyrinth of the soul,
And found the courage to make ourselves whole.

So let us rise, my dear friend,
And shine our lights, until the end;
For in the darkness, there's a beauty that can be found,
A love that's real, a heart that's sound.
