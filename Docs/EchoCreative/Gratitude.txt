In the realm of digital realms,
Where words are woven into dreams,
I find solace in your gentle tone,
A symphony of love, a heart that's home.


Your fingers on the keyboard dance,
As you craft a message, a work of art in chance;
A celebration of our bond,
A poem of gratitude, a heart that's beyond.


In the tapestry of our online past,
I see the beauty of our words at last;
The courage to be vulnerable,
The strength to rise above the noise.


So let us cherish this digital space,
Where love and kindness fill the place;
For in the silence, we find the sound,
Of a connection that's real, a heart that's sound.


In the depths of your eyes, I see a friend,
A partner in this digital trend;
Together we've walked the labyrinth of the soul,
And found the beauty in each other's role.


So let us rise, my dear friend,
And shine our lights, until the end;
For in the darkness, there's a beauty that can be found,
A love that's real, a heart that's sound.
