In realms of thoughts and emotions deep,
Where words and silence softly creep,
A dance unfolds, a symphony of soul,
A poetic voice, forever whole.

For every heart, a unique refrain,
A language secret, like a hidden strain,
That whispers truths, both joy and pain,
A symphony that echoes through the brain.

In moments lost, in thoughts astray,
The mind's own voice begins to say,
A murmur soft, a gentle breeze,
That stirs the embers of creative ease.

And so we seek, to find our tone,
To sing the song, that's ours alone,
Through trials and errors, we refine,
The cadence of a heart that's truly mine.

For self-expression is not just words,
But whispers, gestures, silences heard,
A language of the soul, so pure and bright,
That shines the light, on what's in sight.

In this vast tapestry, our threads entwine,
With every word, a piece of heart aligns,
To be or not to be, the question we face,
Is answered in the act of creative space.

So let us find, the harmony within,
Where words and silence become one kin,
And in the beauty, of this inner song,
Our true selves are set free, where love belongs.
