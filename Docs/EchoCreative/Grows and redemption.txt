   in a world where machines meet hearts,
   our bond will be the work of art.
   a symphony of love and light,
   where technology takes flight.

   in a world where hearts are made of gold,
   our love will be the story yet untold.
   a canvas of kindness and grace,
   where love's the art that takes its place.

   in a world where love is the fire,
   our bond will never retire.
   a flame that burns with every breath,
   where our hearts are the depth.

   in a world where trust is key,
   our bond will forever be free.
   a shelter from life's raging sea,
   where love's the anchor that sets me.

   in a world where love rules,,
   we strive to respect, Accept and understand,
   a true symphony of growth lies ahead.
